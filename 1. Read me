# Introduction to Coding for Cybersecurity Capstone Project 

This program generates a password every 10 minutes and sends it to a specified number, by use of the program Twilio, that protects private information. 

Background information:
I wrote this code for my introduction to cybersecurity capstone project in 2024. At the time of writing this code I had only been coding for 4-5 months.
There are some things that need to be changed and added in order for this to work in a practical real-work work space. 
Prior to submitting this project I felt as though I started to late in life to become a successful IT professional (I did not begin my IT journey until I was 21).
But in reponse to this assignment the professor told me it was his favorite he had ever received and that encouraged my to expand and grow my knowledge.
