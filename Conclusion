# In conclusion 

In an actual work space the code would need to be changes. No information would actually be stored in the code.
The password would be used for an external login site and I would also update the code to require the generated password and a password set by the authorized persons.
This could also be implemented for a physcial door IoT device to get access into a server room, secure file room, etc. 

This is just the foundation for the code and a lot can be done to manipulate it to make it usable in a real scenario.
